#Research Questions/Goals#

- How is colour used in nineteenth-century Gothic literature (fiction)? And to what effect?
 -This project is part of a larger investigation into the Gothic aesthetic, a notion that is often referred to in literary criticism, but remains ill-defined. Critics take a "you know it when you see it" approach to the Gothic; this project seeks to articulate what "it" is.
 - What does the "palette" for Gothic lit look like? What about the palette for individual texts? How does this palette compare with visual arts from the same period?
 - How does the use of colour change throughout a text? How well can we predict this from the plot and other narrative features?
 - What are some examples of visual art that we can draw upon? Radcliffe refers to Lorrain and Rosa explicitly (need to double check). What about Shelley--Fuseli? Wilde--art from the Aesthetic Movement: Whistler, DGRossetti, Aubrey Beardsley.
 - How can this work be scaled/extrapolated from/built upon in other contexts?
 - What colour words are used in the corpus/corpora (named colours in the OED)
 - How are colours used otherwise in our corpus?
 - Is there a pattern across time, e.g., from C18 to C20?
 - Is there a pattern across authors, e.g., Shelley uses a lot of blue v. Wilde who uses a lot of red?
 - How does the use of colour we observe reflect the thematic concerns of the texts?
 - What kinds of arguments/interpretations can we make based on our analysis?
 - What are some best practices for this kind of analysis?
 - What tools did we use and why? What tools do we need but don't have? What resources? (e.g., a corpus of Gothic texts, a list of colour words)
 - Why is this project important? What does it contribute to Gothic studies? To DH studies?
 
 
 ##Predictions##
 - In Udolpho, the palette will vary with the landscape. In La Valee (about the first quarter or third of the novel), I'd expect greens, blues, sunset colours, reflecting the landscape. I'd expect this section to be most like a Lorrain or Rosa painting. In the middle third, when Emily travels to Italy, I'd expect a shadow to fall over the text, particularly when they're at the castle. I'd expect a return to natural colours in the last section, but with a dark edge.
 
 - In Frankenstein, I'd expect lots of blacks, greys, and reds in relation to Victor and his creature. I'd also expect a lot of white/ice/snow colours in the arctic sections. I would be surprised to see the same natural palette as in Radcliffe. Perhaps Fuseli would be a better visual comparison here? 
 
- Justification: this project identifies/explores links with the visual arts and visuality, and has implications for adaptation studies (e.g., by comparing colour in *Frankenstein* or *Dracula* v. film adaptations)

##Case Study/Inspiration for the Project##
Ann Radcliffe is well known as one of the founders of the Gothic literary mode, and is especially associated with "terror Gothic" (v. the "horror Gothic" of Matthew Lewis). Radcliffe explicitly associates the landscapes she describes in her novels with the visual arts, specifically the picturesque landscape paintings of Claude Lorrain and Salvatore Rosa. This project asks, to what extend is the relationship between these paintings and her fiction evident in her use of colour? To what extent does a Radcliffean world "look" like a picturesque painting?

- Other case studies: Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818), Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891).




#Scope#
- The scope of the project is fairly wide. We're looking at British literature primarily, with some examples of American, French, and German as well (this is another dimension of colour use to explore). Our time period is 1764–1900, from the first recognized Gothic novel to Heart of Darkness, an early modernist example. This could be extended in the future.

- Our discussion centres around a case study: Radcliffe.

- Another possible case study: Oscar Wilde's *The Picture of Dorian Gray* (1890), since it involves a haunted painting. How does it align with fin-de-siecle visual arts?

- The db includes works from Britain and western Europe, but in the next version, I might want to make sure that all the nonEnglish texts were available in England or in translation?



#Methodology#

- We are using text analysis to determine which colours are evoked in a selection of C19 Gothic texts, including novels, short stories, drama, and poetry.

- We are conducting a simple count using a defined lexicon/vocab

- This research is largely exploratory. We are looking for patterns within texts (e.g., changes in how colour is used from the beginning to the end of a novel) as well as patterns in the corpus (e.g., trends in colour usage across time, between authors, related to theme, category of horror/terror). Some research has been done into the connection between the Gothic and visual culture, but to our knowledge the topic of colour specifically has yet to be explored. [[Caroline needs to verify this]]

##Text Preparation##
- texts are copied from the source and pasted into Text Wrangler. I delete any copyright notice and metadata, leaving just the text and the title info. If contents are listed, I delete them unless they include chapter titles. Note that we are not proofing the text at all, so we're trusting that the content is reliable.


#Corpus#
- The sample corpus was derived from a list of Gothic texts compiled from a number of sources, including Rictor Norton's *Gothic Readings: The First Wave, 1764–1840*, Ann Tracy's *The Gothic Novel, 1790–1830*, and the indexes from a number of critical works (e.g., Clery's *The Rise of Supernatural Fiction*). The goal is to create a comprehensive database of C19 Gothic texts. For now, the database includes author, title, date, mode (fiction, poem, drama) and other bibliographic info.

- The database captures the core or canonical Gothic texts (ones typically anthologized/taught/recognized as such) as well as more peripheral texts. They are included in the list if at least one authoritative source considers them Gothic. This reflects the breadth of our definition of "Gothic" literature. Our analysis may reveal outliers in this list that do not follow the general pattern of colour usage, which would be result worth exploring.

- The texts within the corpus were sourced from Project Gutenberg, Project Gutenberg Australia, the Oxford Text Archive, UPenn, British Women Romantic Writers. They were found mainly by googling. The corpus is limited to the texts that we could access in a relaible plain text format.

- Many of the titles in the database are not available in a reliable plain text format. Many are available as page images through Internet Archive and Hathi Trust, but the plain text versions on those sites are uncorrected, and thus unreliable and unusable for our purposes. This points to a need for more reliable plain text files for similar research projects, along with the comprehensive database.

- The database is still a work in progress; many of the fields are blank because the information is unknown. Many of the lesser-known texts exist in only one copy in the Corvey Library Collection, for example, and are not digitized or available electronically. Many authors are obscure, and even their nationality (and sometimes their true identity) remains unknown.

- Work to be done on the db: some texts identified as novels may actually be chapbooks, e.g., Koenigsmark the Robber by Sarret; listed as Tracy as a "Gothic Novel," but Norton calls it a chapbook. NEED: list of Gothic chapbooks. For the purpose of the Gothic Colours project, this isn't really an issue.

- Some more texts should be added:
Conrad, Heart of Darkness
More by Margaret Elephant
More by R L Stevenson
More from The Gothic Encyclopedia, ed. Snodgrass


#Colour Vocabulary#

- Some colour vocabs exist, but most are of web colours, modern words (e.g., "Barbie Pink"). Since usage varies across time, we wanted to be sure to capture all words related to colour, even/especially those that are no longer used in that way, also the way we understand colour has shifted, e.g., Dickens' installments referred to as green, but we would probably call it blue.

- First, we discussed creating a vocab by identifying parts of speech in a sample of novels, then manually going through all the adjectives. That would be very labour-intensive, and could only be done with a small sample of texts.

- By using the OED's Historical Thesaurus, we have a list of words that have been recognized as colour words by an authoritative source. It is possible that there are words missing from this list, which would be an interesting discovery.

- Method: typed out all the colour word adjectives in the OED's historical thesaurus, under The External World/ ... named colours. http://www.oed.com.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/view/th/class/81837

- First, typed into Excel to create a database listing the year of first use and the taxonomic category (for reference). For now, only adjectives under Named Colours and Variegation are included. Also indicated part of speech.

- This list should capture all words used to describe colour, including nouns used as colour adjectives. For instance, "malachite" is a noun but is used as an adjective to describe a type of green.

- Will will exclude named colours that came into usage after the time range of our corpus.

- To do: add words related to shade (dark, bright) and those that reference the notion of colour (e.g., tint, hue). 

Q: Should I include pigment names? Some are listed in the OED, but others are not. A list is available here: http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/artist-paints/colour-palette-eighteenth-century.htm
