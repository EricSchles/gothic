#Colour Vocabulary#

Method: typed out all the colour word adjectives in the OED's historical thesaurus, under The External World/ ... named colours. http://www.oed.com.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/view/th/class/81837

First, typed into Excel to create a database listing the year of first use and the taxonomic category (for reference). For now, only adjectives under Named Colours and Variegation are included. Also indicated part of speech.

This list should capture all words used to describe colour, including nouns used as colour adjectives. For instance, "malachite" is a noun but is used as an adjective to describe a type of green.

Q: Should I include pigment names? Some are listed in the OED, but others are not. A list is available here: http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/artist-paints/colour-palette-eighteenth-century.htm
